/// Tiled view of FrameState
///
/// This is the top-level tiling structure, providing tiling views of its
/// data when necessary.
///
/// It is intended to be created from a tile-interator on FrameState.
///
/// Contrary to PlaneRegionMut and TileMut, there is no const version:
///  - in practice, we don't need it;
///  - it would not be free to convert from TileStateMut to TileState, since
///    several of its fields will also need the instantiation of
///    const-equivalent structures.
///
/// # TileState fields
///
/// The way the FrameState fields are mapped depend on how they are accessed
/// tile-wise and frame-wise.
///
/// Some fields (like "qc") are only used during tile-encoding, so they are only
/// stored in TileState.
///
/// Some other fields (like "input" or "segmentation") are not written
/// tile-wise, so they just reference the matching field in FrameState.
///
/// Some others (like "rec") are written tile-wise, but must be accessible
/// frame-wise once the tile views vanish (e.g. for deblocking).
///
/// The "restoration" field is more complicated: some of its data
/// (restoration units) are written tile-wise, but shared between several
/// tiles. Therefore, they are stored in FrameState with interior mutability
/// (protected by a mutex), and referenced from TileState.
/// See <https://github.com/xiph/rav1e/issues/631#issuecomment-454419152>.
///
/// This is still work-in-progress. Some fields are not managed correctly
/// between tile-wise and frame-wise accesses.
